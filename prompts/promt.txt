I will provide a JSON file representing a GitHub repository’s file tree (as returned by the GitHub API's /git/trees endpoint).

Your task is to generate a professional-quality README.md with:

✅ Required Sections:
📖 Project Title and Description

Guess what the project is about based on file/folder names.

📁 Folder Structure

Use a code block to visually show the tree (like tree command output).

Include short inline comments on each folder/file when possible.

🚀 Getting Started

Give steps to clone, install dependencies, and run the project.

Include terminal commands using code blocks.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Guess based on file names (package.json, requirements.txt, .java, etc.).

🧪 Scripts / Commands

Mention any scripts/, Makefile, run.sh, etc. if found.

📄 License

If there's a LICENSE file, assume it's MIT unless specified.

👤 Author / Done By

If there’s any name in folder/file paths or infer from repo name/structure.

🎯 Additional Notes

Optional: Add badges, emojis, links, anything cool that enhances appearance.

✅ Use markdown, headings, emojis, code blocks, and bullets to make it visually clean and modern.
